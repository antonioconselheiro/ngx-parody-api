> [43] Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. [44] But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; [45] that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: **for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.**

## Parody Projects
Parody projects are jokes in the form of fully functional clients nostr.

 - [Omeglestr](https://github.com/antonioconselheiro/omeglestr) was the last joke told, you can access [this here](https://antonioconselheiro.github.io/omeglestr/#/chat).
 - [Twitter ᴾᵃʳᵒᵈʸ](https://github.com/antonioconselheiro/twitter-parody) it's a joke in progress.

I'm still going to tell a lot of jokes, all algorithms with nostr that allow these clients to perform their respective social network interactions will be centralized in this library.

Many will say that it is just a work of plagiarism and that there is no joke. If you do not understand humor and do not want to acquire a joke, do not interfere with my business.
